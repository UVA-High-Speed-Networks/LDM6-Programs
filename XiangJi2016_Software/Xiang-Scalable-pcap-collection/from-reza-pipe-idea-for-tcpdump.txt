[HSN Research Group] Huge pcap file solution
Hi again,

Here is a very nice solution for huge tcpdump large size files.

The solution is so simple. Creating a pipe between tcpdump output and tcptrace input.


mkfifo tmppipe 
tcptrace -r -l tmppipe (in one terminal/command line) 
tcpdump -w tmppipe (in other terminal/command line) 

Xiang can test this solution on his problem and please let us know the result.

Regards,
Reza
