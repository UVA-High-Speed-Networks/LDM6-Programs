[HSN Research Group] Reducing "tcpdump" drop rate with a simple idea
Hi All,

I found this page an interesting way to reduce packets drop in "tcpdump".

This method may not be helpful with one flow but at least for my tests which scalability is important (thousands of flows), I should take into account this issue.
