This file explains the LDM measurement scripts.

For LDM, we measured metrics as latency, aggregate throughput, cpu usage, loss rate.

The shell scripts folder includes all the scripts were used for running the LDM experiment. 

The master_script.sh is used for initializing the experiment which invokes the logger.sh, and cpu mem usage.sh. Inserting the test data product into the product queue in LDM. 

The test.sh is the start button for the experiment. Since it call tcpdump, we use it as below:

./test.sh &

The scripts will run in the system background.

The parser for result folder includes all the parsers for experiment result.

cpu mem usage parser parses the cpu mem log generated by command ps.

The aggregate throughput parser calculate the 200 MB aggregate size throughput from the ldm log file.
